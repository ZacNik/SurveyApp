# Employee Survey Mobile App

Challenge/Context: The objective of this project was to create a survey application that enables users to collect feedback and responses from Employees, particularly for UPS employees based on my systems analysis project. The challenge involved developing a mobile application that could be deployed to all UPS devices with a user-friendly interface for conducting surveys, storing survey data efficiently, and implementing navigation between different screens.

Action: Using Kotlin programming language and Jetpack Compose UI toolkit, we developed a mobile application for conducting surveys. The application utilizes SQLite database for storing survey questions and user responses. The frontend interface was designed with Jetpack Compose to provide a modern and intuitive user experience. Navigation between survey screens was implemented using the Navigation component.

Result: The project resulted in a functional survey application capable of creating and conducting surveys. Users can navigate through different survey questions, select multiple-choice options, or provide open-ended responses. The application stores survey data locally on the device and displays a confirmation screen upon completion of the survey.

Reflection: Throughout the project, we gained valuable experience in Kotlin programming and Jetpack Compose development. Challenges were encountered in designing the survey navigation flow and integrating the SQLite database for data storage. However, through collaboration and problem-solving, I successfully delivered a robust survey application. In future iterations, focus would be on enhancing data management capabilities, implementing user authentication, and adding features for exporting survey data.
